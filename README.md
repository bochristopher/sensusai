# SensusAI: AI-Powered Sensor Validation Suite

SensusAI is a modular validation framework for autonomous vehicle sensors, enhanced with embedded AI agents. It is built for engineers, researchers, and AV companies looking to streamline and scale validation of lidar, camera, and sensor fusion systems.

## 🚗 Core Use Cases
- Validate sensor performance across weather, lighting, and motion
- Automate test pipelines and failure analysis
- Use AI agents to suggest next steps or spot regression patterns
- Visualize test results and insights with a web dashboard

## 🧠 Why AI?
Modern sensor stacks are too complex to validate with static scripts alone. SensusAI uses embedded AI agents (LLMs or custom ML models) to:
- Summarize failure logs
- Suggest retests and scenarios
- Flag potential issues in fleet logs
- Adapt test strategy on the fly

## 🔌 Modules
- `framework/`: Sensor-specific validation tools
- `agent/`: AI agent logic (connects to OpenAI or custom model)
- `scripts/`: CLI runner to simulate test executions
- `dashboard/`: Flask dashboard for live feedback
- `.github/`: CI workflows

## 🧪 Example: Use OpenAI for Insight

```python
import openai

def suggest_with_openai(sensor_input):
    openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    prompt = f"Suggest a validation strategy based on: {sensor_input}"
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
```

## 🚀 Quickstart
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sensusai.git
cd sensusai
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/run_validation.py
```
